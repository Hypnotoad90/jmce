_____________________________________________________________________________
    

   Hello there, my friend jumpers, this is a sequel project of JumPix,
called JumPix II, featuring additional maps and stuff.
   This project consists mainly of Erduke's maps, all of them following the
theme of open fortress surrounded by a water, with some additional maps from
AC3 and AAC. This is A-version with first 10 maps, B-version is planned and
it will have maps with darker and moody theme, as you can now see in the
demo map Library "JPX2BDEM". There will be also 10 maps, but currently there
are some free map spots so you can make a map for this project if you are
interested.

Enjoy!

Hisymak
