   Hello Jumpmazers! It's been a very long time, more than 2.5 years, since
last Jumpix release. Jumpix was slightly worked on during the time, but was
still not ready. AC3 started to have a lot of work and very few time for 
developing Jumpix and became inactive, same with Frank.
   Now I finally took the care of Jumpix and managed to finish it off!
   So here is a big new update! Hmm, maybe not so big. It has just two brand
new maps, two map updates and several bugfixes. But it has now full 32 maps!
Jumpix is very near to be finished completely, this is almost final version.
Jumpix is not accepting any new maps, but one exception is here. Map Itaipu
(JPX30) is still not complete. AC3 ran out of ideas. But it may be you who
complete this amazing final Jumpix map! But if you want to do it, you must
respect current map storyline and do rest of map in same or better quality.
   Also there is one more unfinished map made by AAC and AC3, called 
"The Unknown". This map is not included and AAC/AC3 will most likely never
finish it. It's a pity, but if you are interested in it, tell me.
   I really wanted to do this a perfect-quality pk3, with no bugs, or as
few bugs as possible. However, everybody is making mistakes, so if you find
any bug, don't hesitate to contact me! Especially, there could be bugs in
new maps (JPX29, JPX30 and JPX32).
   Finally, I'm also leader of Jumpix II along with Erduke. I very like this
project and Erduke's maps and I'm ready to help Erduke fix his amazing
maps and help him release them. Look forward to new Jumpix II releases!
Also, there is much free place in Jummpix II, so you may make a map for it,
but you should respect the project's theme and map design.
   You can find me ocassionally on IRC or my e-mail is kozten@seznam.cz.

   Enjoy and Have a Nice Game!

     Hi!
     So if you want to subbmit a map to me or AC3 it has to be detailed. Im sorry if AC3 or
I turn you down; BUT, if i think its a good map ill detail it for you.  If We tell you its
no good you may edit it yourself and send it back to us. This might happen multiple times.
(this happened when i tried to get my first map into  jm2, ThePlayer ended up editing it 
and I didn't really like it.) So if you let me edit your map you may tell me that you don't 
like it. I won't mind. Please don't use  3D floors unless they are backed up with textures
so softies (People in software mode) can see. Also use projectiles to a minimum 
(they lag BADLY!) Keep them well designed,  problem free, but mostly fun!
	With gratuitous amounts of love

    Hi there, we so sorry for not releasing the last month, my notebook died and couldn't
recover my fixes, updates and maps. But i remade all the things again, too much work i had.
But we have new maps, new interface and new songs to listen ;D.
    Hopefully you enjoy this next update.

	This is the latest update of JumPix.
	I cant believe how this could happend again. 2 times. I forgot to save the "WADS" 
folder and reinstalled Windows violently. Moments later, i wanted to recover my data from 
LICOIR-PC, but, it was too late. He reinstalled the OS too, leaving me WITHOUT any wads. 
Nowaday, I'm  downloading all the lost wads and remaking my last updates for this Project. 
Unless i could get the data of my notebook dead.

Note: If you get any problems with textures, make sure your skulltag_data.pk3 is updated to r85.

You can download from here: http://stprojects.drdteam.org/skulltag_data_r85.zip

Happy new year!

	Here's another update of JumPix. we've fixed many possible bugs and arranged some 
scripts. Also the jpx30 is available as trial version; in a few months I'll get finished 
the map and will be fully playable. Needs time to make 100% the best map.

	Enjoy!
